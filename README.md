# Digipodium's Internship program
We are welcoming creative coders and techies to be a part of Digipodium. This Internship program has been created for those individuals that are looking to turn their knowledge into skills with experience. 

### *Defination of Internship*
*An internship is a period of work experience offered by an organization for a limited period of time. An internship consists of an exchange of services for experience between the intern and the organization. Internships are used to determine if the intern still has an interest in that field after the real-life experience. In addition, an internship can be used to create a professional network that can assist with letters of recommendation or lead to future employment opportunities.*
